you have a point
it should be such that
if it does not detect a face for 1 second and it is charging
it should continue unit it locks
and if it sees there is no need to lock, then disable


 use facerec to detect your actual face

# A password should be then asked when the program is started such that
# we avoid a foreigner getting the face recognized with it
